Procedure to create a new WPA project on MPLAB X IDE.
The procedure described below was based on MPLAB X IDE v5.15.

1. Open MPLAB X IDE

2. File -> New Project

 2.1 Choose Project
 2.1.1 Categories: Microchip Embedded
 2.1.2 Projects: Standalone Project

 2.2 Select Device
 2.2.1 Family: 16-bit DSCs (dsPIC33)
 2.2.2 Device: dsPIC33FJ128MC804

 2.3 Select Tool (Optional)
 2.3.1 If you are using the picpgm software via the RaspberryPi to program the dsPic, you don't need to select a programming tool
 2.3.2 You can learn more on how to program the dsPic with picpgm on https://www.elab.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/wiki/index.php?title=DsPic-Raspberry_programmer_interface#Software_use

 2.4 Select Compiler
 2.4.1 Select XC16. If not available, it needs to be installed: https://microchipdeveloper.com/xc16:installation

 2.5 Select Project Name and Folder
 2.5.1 Project Name: wpa (for example)
 2.5.2 Project Location: (your choice)
 2.5.3 Leave the "Set as main project" tickbox set
 2.5.4 Keep the "Enconding" as it is (ISO-8859-1)
 2.5.5 Press Finish

3. On the Projects tab, under the project name choosen above (wpa in this example), right click on "Source Files", then:
 3.1 Select Adding Existing Items...
 3.2 Select all the files with the extension .c or .s (you can use the "Files of type" filter option to more easily select them)
 3.3 At the end of the selection, the full list of source files should be:
    adc.c
    ball.c
    d7seg_max7219.c
    delays.c
    etc.c
    flash.c
    laser.c
    main.c
    mcpwm.c
    memory.s
    msg.c
    pendulum_N_osc.c
    physical.c
    shovel.c
    state_machine.c
    timers.c
    traps.c

4. Repeat a similar procedure as in 3. but for the "Header Files":
 4.1 Select all the files with the extension .h
 4.2 At the end of the selection, the full list of header files should be:
    adc.h
    ball.h
    d7seg_max7219.h
    delays.h
    etc.h
    flash.h
    laser.h
    mcpwm.h
    memory.h
    msg.h
    pendulum_N_osc.h
    physical.h
    shovel.h
    state_machine.h
    timers.h
    world_pendulum.h

5. At this point, you can now "Clean and Build the Main Project", under "Production"
 5.1 This will create a new .hex file (see output log shell for location of the file, usually under ./wpa.X/dist/default/...)
 5.2 Use the new .hex file to update the dsPIC firmware
